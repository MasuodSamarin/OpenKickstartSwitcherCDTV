# OpenKickstartSwitcher CDTV Edition
OpenKickstartSwitcherCDTV is an Open Hardware Kickstart Switcher for the Commodore CDTV.

### Summary
OpenKickstartSwitcherCDTV is a Kickstart switcher for the Commodore CDTV Entertainment System, based on [work by Henryk Richter](http://bax.comlab.uni-rostock.de/en/hardware/amiga500/kickstart-eprom/). It is basically the same circuit/board as [OpenKickstartSwitcher](https://github.com/SukkoPera/OpenKickstartSwitcher) but tailored in shape to the CDTV.

It allows switching among three or six different Kickstart images, stored in an EPROM. Switching can be done through two physical switches or by pressing the mouse/joystick buttons at power-up. The latter requires [an external add-on board](https://github.com/SukkoPera/OpenAmigaMouseTrigger) that is another project of mine.

### Assembly
Solder all components to the board. Starting with the smaller components might be a good idea, and make sure to solder the pin headers and resistor arrays before the socket. When soldering the resistor arrays, don't push them fully through the holes, as you will need to bend them against the board. No particular order is recommended for the remaining components.

The value of the two single resistors is not critical, 10k is recommended but probably any value between 5k and 50k will do.

My tests show that an SN74HC00 gate works fine. I don't recommend using parts from the *HC* series though, *HCT* or *LS* should be preferred.

The two resistor arrays are not always needed. You might get away without them, depending on the particular EPROM you are using: I have several EPROMs of the same model (but different production batches), and some need the resistors while others don't, so the only way to find out is actual testing. If you decide to install them, they must be of the *bussed* type and the recommended value is 4.7k. Be aware that these parts are polarized and must be installed with the right orientation!

### EPROM Programming
I recommend using 27C800-100F1 or 27C160-100F1 EPROMs by ST. Access time is not critical: use 100ns or faster EPROMs if you can, but anything up to 150ns should work reliably.

When flashing the EPROM, make sure that the ROM images you are using are exactly 2x262144 and 1x524288 bytes long, and just concatenate them. Take care to use the correct byte ordering, as the Amiga hardware expects 16-bit words to be stored in the *big-endian* format (which is NOT the format UAE expects them in, for the record).

Note that 27C800s and 27C160 are 42-pin EPROMs and most programmers only support chips up to 40 pins. This is the case with [the popular TL866 programmer](http://autoelectric.cn/EN/TL866_main.html), for instance. You can get around this limitation with an adapter PCB. There are at least two open designs of such an adapter:
* [One by keirff](https://github.com/keirf/PCB-Projects) (who, interestingly, has his own Kickstart Switcher)
* [And another one by gaggi](https://github.com/gaggi/27c160-tl866-adapter)

I have only used the latter and found it to be working fine.

### Installation
Once your OpenKickstartSwitcherCDTV is assembled and programmed, the rest of the installation should be pretty straightforward:
* Open your CDTV.
* Remove the shielding.
* Identify the Kickstart chip.
* Carefully remove it.
* Plug OpenKickstartSwitcher in its place, making sure to match the correct orientation.
* Drill two holes into the back of your CDTV (or wherever you prefer) and screw two switches in there.
* Solder wires to switches.
* Replace your shielding.
* Close your CDTV.

### Kickstart selection
The adapter can be used with either 27C800 or 27C160 EPROMs.

#### 27C800
With a 27C800 EPROM, the adapter supports 2x256 KB Kickstart images (i.e.: up to version 1.3) and 1x512 KB image (version 2 and later).

To switch between ROMs, you will need two switches, connected to the SW1/SW2 pads. A ground pad is available on the board, but any ground spot on the mainboard can be used as well, if easier to reach. Then:

* If SW2 is HIGH, the 512 KB Kickstart image is selected, regardless of SW1.
* If SW2 is LOW, SW1 controls which one of the two 256 KB images is enabled: LOW selects the first one, and HIGH selects the second one.

As SW1/SW2 will both read as HIGH if left unconnected, the 512 Kickstart will be selected if no switches are wired.

Note that you can fully ignore the A19 pad on the bottom side of the board, when using a 27C800 EPROM.

#### 27C160
With a 27C160 EPROM, the adapter supports up to 4x256 KB Kickstart images and 2x512 KB images.

You will need to solder an additional switch to the A19 pad on the bottom side of the board. VCC and GND pads are provided nearby so that you can also solder a pull-up/down resistor.

| ROM Image # | Size (KB) | SW1 | SW2 | A19 |
|-------------|-----------|-----|-----|-----|
| 1           | 256       | LOW | LOW | LOW |
| 2           | 256       | HIGH| LOW | LOW |
| 3           | 512       |  x  | HIGH| LOW |
| 4           | 256       | LOW | LOW | HIGH|
| 5           | 256       | HIGH| LOW | HIGH|
| 6           | 512       |  x  | HIGH| HIGH|

**IMPORTANT: ALWAYS TURN YOUR CDTV OFF BEFORE MOVING THE SELECTION SWITCHES.**

### DiagROM
The excellent [DiagROM by chucky](http://www.diagrom.com) can be used with OpenKickstartSwitcherCDTV, even though not all functions work on a CDTV.

Normally it is distributed as a 512 KB image, but most of the space is unused, so I have created a 256 KB version of DiagROM 1.0 by simply truncating the image. It is **NOT GUARANTEED TO WORK**, but it looks fine to me. It can be [downloaded here](https://github.com/SukkoPera/OpenKickstartSwitcher/files/1777856/diagrom-256k.zip).

### Support the Project
Since the project is open you are free to get the PCBs made by your preferred manufacturer, however in case you want to support the development, you can order them from PCBWay through this link:

[![PCB from PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/project/img/images/frompcbway.png)](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/OpenKickstartSwitcherCDTV_V1.html)

You get cheap, professionally-made and good quality PCBs, I get some credit that will help with this and [other projects](https://www.pcbway.com/project/member/shareproject/?bmbid=41100). You won't even have to worry about the various PCB options, it's all pre-configured for you!

Also, if you still have to register to that site, [you can use this link](https://www.pcbway.com/setinvite.aspx?inviteid=41100) to get some bonus initial credit (and yield me some more).

Again, if you want to use another manufacturer, feel free to, don't feel obligated :).
